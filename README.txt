ABOUT Team5_FinalProject
Team5_FinalProject is an Android application created in Android Studio. This application is used for Clemson University students, prospective students, alumni, and fans. It allows them to be able to to get current information about their use of the application, and current students can create a profile which holds there classes. The application also has a google maps API, which allows for them to be able to look up areas on campus and use that to find locations throughout campus. Another aspect of this application is the sports area which shows the most current sports game occuring and has the different types of penalities so that you can learn more about the game while watching. Finally, we have a game that is attached to the application. This part of the application has a trivia game, and icons to try to win. The trivia game asks you 10 questions and you can see how many out of 10 questions you can get right. The icons are different events to attend at Clemson like sports events, or traditions complete. If you can show this completition in sometimes through a photo than you can receive that icon. The colors that were choosen related to Clemson University's colors for Orange, Purple, and white. We did not make the background purple because a white background with black writing seemed like the best solution for people trying to read and gain information. However, we tried to make all the buttons purple so it will be universal throughout the entire application.
